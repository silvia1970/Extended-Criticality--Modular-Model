# Extended-Criticality--Modular-Model
Role of criticality in the structure-function relationship in the human brain: Modular LIF large-scale brain model with extended critical region

The code is the modular large-scale LIF  model, with spatiotemporal patterns replay and an extended critical region, as described in the paper
"The role of criticality in the structure-function relationship in the human brain" Angiolelli et al. 2025. 
It is an updated version of the model described in the paper "Information capacity of a network of spiking neurons" S. Scarpetta, A. de Candia Physica A 2020, and "Critical Behavior and Memory Function in a Model of Spiking Neurons with a Reservoir of Spatio-Temporal Patterns" in the Functional Role of Critical Dynamics in Neural Systems, Springer Series  11 S. Scarpetta 2019.

The program is in c++.  Use the command "make" to compile, and "./a.out" to run. The program reads the parameters of the simulation from the file "SEED". For any question and information please refer to Silvia Scarpetta sscarpetta@unisa.it
