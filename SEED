topo=tract1     % topo=random chooses the sequence of modules for each pattern randomly (otherwise, use tract1 for human tractography data)
               % to use tract1, there must be 66 modules, so set S=66 cortical regions according to DKT atlas
S=66           % number of modules
Z=200          % number of neurons per module
G=12           % number of modules for each pattern
K=100          % number of active neurons for each active module
P=20           % total number of patterns stored in the network
sort=0         % if sort=2: new Gaussian bump with standard deviation range measured in number of modules
